## Overview

### Project Description

This was my first solo project at the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. Solo project means that you are only provided with the Figma design file and a set of requirements you need to implement in the project. There is no hand-holding or a walk-through solution with the instructor. How you solve the challenge and implement the logic is completely up to you.

A stretch goal in this project was to add an input for the user to change the number and make the app automatically recalculate values when it changes. Originally the number was supposed to be saved to a variable in the code (= hard-coded).

New things learned:
- block default behavior on submit by using event.preventDefault()
- round numbers to a certain point of decimal places with toFixed()
- pass in an array as a rest parameter and apply toFixed()-method to each of the numbers in the array with map()

The page is fully responsive.
